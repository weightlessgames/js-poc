Atura in JavaScript / ClojureScript
======
Atura is a sci-fi/space opera platformer action rpg.

Stack
======
This proof of concept will explore JavaScript (specifically
ClojureScript) to see if it's a viable platform using:
- CreateJS
- The Platypus game engine https://github.com/PBS-KIDS/Platypus
- The Tiled map editor http://www.mapeditor.org/

TO-DO
======
This list details specific next steps and should be updated after any
relevant commits.

- Build the opening level using Tiled.
- Add the first player character.
- Give the first player character a generic gun.
- Add bullets and bullet physics.
- Use a SQL backend for saving characters.
- Deploy to Heroku or AWS and access online.
